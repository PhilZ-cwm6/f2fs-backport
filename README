f2fs-backport
==============

The Flash-Friendly File System(f2fs) initially backported to Linux 3.0 by Now Computing, now maintained by arter97.

This repository is based on linux-3.0.y branch, which is the latest Linux 3.0.101.

This repository contains the latest f2fs from the official mainline git repository:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jaegeuk/f2fs.git (branch dev)



Branch
======

The "master" branch will always be force updated to show the required patches on the very top.
Please use the "master" branch ONLY if you've imported f2fs to your source code yourself.
It will be a bad idea to use "git merge" towards the "master" branch.

The "merge" branch will NOT be force updated for making it suitable for "git merge".



Commits
=======

The official mainline f2fs git repository is usually force updated,
making us hard to cherry-pick each commits made by f2fs developers.

So, instead of seeing the actual f2fs commits on this repository,
you'll see "fs: rework f2fs" commits.

This commit will always contain the latest f2fs, including its force updated changes.



How-to
======

1. If you've already imported f2fs by yourself:
   Go just cherry-pick the "f2fs: support 3.0".

2. If you don't have f2fs on your 3.0 kernel:
   Use git's automated merge to include the latest f2fs.

   Use this command to add this repository to your local git:
   $ git remote add f2fs-backport https://arter97@bitbucket.org/arter97/f2fs-backport.git

   And repeat this command to apply & fetch the latest f2fs changes:
   $ git fetch f2fs-backport
   $ git merge f2fs-backport/merge

   Please note that if your git repository is not upstreamed with Linux 3.0.101 using git merge,
   you'll find yourself in trouble with lots of merge conflicts.
   In this case, restructure your git upstreamed with Linux 3.0.101 using git merge,
   or import f2fs yourself and follow the 1st instructions.
